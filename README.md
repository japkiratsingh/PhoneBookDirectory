# PhoneBookDirectory
In this project we have made a phone directory using tries data structure, tries are basically a data structures that are also called as prefix trees. 
The word "Trie" is an excerpt from the word "retrieval". Trie is a sorted tree-based dataï¿¾structure that stores the set of strings. It has the number of pointers equal to the number of characters of the alphabet in each node. It can search a word in the dictionary with the help of 
the word's prefix. For example, if we assume that all strings are formed from the letters 'a' to 'z' in the English alphabet, each trie node can have a maximum of 26 points.
Trie is also known as the digital tree or prefix tree. The position of a node in the Trie determines the key with which that node is connected.
1. The root node of the trie always represents the null node.
2. Each child of nodes is sorted alphabetically.
3. Each node can have a maximum of 26 children (A to Z).
4. Each node (except the root) can store one letter of the alphabet.
We have also coded a simple code in Linked List for phone directory as we first had some problem with implementing TRIE. Linked is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at a continuous memory location. Linked list is a sequence of links that are stored randomly in the memory where a node has the address for the next node.
